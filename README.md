## Description

### Preview

[![preview image](./client/src/assets/images/beat-hub.jpg)](https://beathub.herokuapp.com/)

This application is deployed at https://beathub.herokuapp.com/

Beethub is an interactive album-collection sharing experience. It is built for people who treat music as a lifestyle. Name and save collections, review albums from anywhere by clicking or tapping, and see other users' choices in real time. Beathub is integrated with Spotify, and has access to Spotify's full library of album artwork, artists, and more. There's no need to keep track of another subscription if you use BeetHub!

The app is built on MongoDB and the entire front end is built with react. The app is responsive and mobile-friendly, so you always have access.

## Installation

Note: This is only necessary if you intend on deploying the app yourself. Otherwise, enjoy the deployment on Heroku, no install required.

It is important that you have both node.js and MongoDB installed before attempting to install the rest of the application's dependencies and running it.

Clone the repo from GitHub first.

Begin by running `npm install` in your terminal. Once this is finished, the app should be ready to start.

## Usage

Run `npm run develop` in your terminal and wait for the app to display in your default browser. For troubleshooting, it is sometimes best to `cd` into either server or client directories and run `npm watch` or `npm start` respectively.
